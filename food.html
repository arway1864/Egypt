        <h2>Kushari</h2>
        <p>  Carb overload coming right at you! Come lunch time in Cairo you ll
          see a stack of locals lined up at every kushari shop around, waiting
          for a hearty portion of one of Egypt s favourite street foods. This

          tomato sauce, garlic vinegar and garnished with chickpeas and fried
          onions. It s a perfect meal that is substantial, nutrient-packed and

        <h2>ful we tameya</h2>
        <p>  Ta meya and ful mudammas, which are essentially fava beans and
          falafel are the original Egyptian fast-foods. They re a staple of
          the Egyptian diet, mainly because they re filling and use
          ingredients that are easily accessible in the country. The ful is
          made of fava beans that are cooked for hours in a pot called a
          qedra. The ta-meya, which is an Egyptian falafel, is made out of
          crushed fava beans that is later made into a paste, then fried.
          Nowadays you can find falafels all over the Middle East however,
          Egypt is the actual origin of those delightful fried treats. A
          perfect dish for all you vegos!</p>

        <H2>Shawarma</H2>
        <p>Marinated and spit-roasted, shawarma is a delicious Middle Eastern
           meat treat whose origins can be traced back to the Ottoman Empire era, 
           while its name stems from the Arabic pronunciation of the Turkish word 
           Ã§evirme (lit. to turn; turning), and refers to the rotating skewer on 
           which the meat is cooked.</p>
